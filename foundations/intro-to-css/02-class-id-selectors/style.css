/* 
here I tried doing .odd.special first because I thought I should make sure that I am 
differentiating between the elements and selecting the same elements. but I 
realized that I can simply do .special and add it to <p class = "odd special"> and it
would work without any issues. Chaining is not explicitly necessary because It is much 
simpler this way. 

if I really need three styles, ie, one for .odd, one for .special 
and one that explicit style for .odd.special like for <p class="odd special"> then this 
would be the case.
